# MOST Important guidelines
The following are the MOST important guidelines to follow when editing files in this repository:
- never update files under the `/docs/specs/_archive/` directory. They are kept for historical reference only.
- ONLY the Product Owner agent is allowed to edit the roadmap file located at `/docs/roadmap.md`! When any other agent needs changes to the roadmap, they must hand off to the Product Owner agent.
